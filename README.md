# CSV Automation Script

A lightweight and interactive Bash script to manage employee records stored in a CSV file. Ideal for Linux users who want to handle basic data operations directly from the terminal without using spreadsheets or databases.

## 🚀 Features

- **Add Data**: Insert a new employee record with ID, name, age, and domain.
- **Update Data**: Modify existing records by entering the employee ID.
- **Delete Data**: Remove an entry based on employee ID.
- **Filter Data**: Display records by filtering on the employee domain.
- **Sort Data**: Sort the CSV file (e.g., by domain) while preserving the header.
- **Log Changes**: All actions are logged with timestamps in `changes.log`.

## 🛠️ How It Works

The script relies on standard Linux commands like `grep`, `sort`, and `head/tail` to process a `data.csv` file. Each user action is prompted through the terminal, making it beginner-friendly and easy to use. Every change made is automatically logged for transparency.

## 📦 Files Included

- `csv_automation.sh` – The main shell script.
- `data.csv` – The CSV file containing employee data.
- `changes.log` – A log file recording all changes made through the script.

## ▶️ Usage

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   bash csv_automation.sh
   ```
3. Follow the prompts to add, update, delete, filter, or sort data.
